I am a Distinguished Professor and Director of [Xiangshan Laboratory Wireless Group](http://xslwireless.net), [Zhongshan Institute](https://zs.cust.edu.cn) of [Changchun University of Science and Technology](https://cust.edu.cn), China. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) in the USA, where I studied under the guidance of Prof. [Raj Mittra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Mittra). I received my master’s degree in RF and Microwave Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology](https://beta.iitkgp.ac.in) in Kharagpur, India, under the supervision of Prof. [Ramesh Garg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesh_Garg) and my bachelor’s degree from [Delhi Technological University](http://www.dtu.ac.in) in Delhi, India. 

Before joining the Zhongshan Institute at Changchun University of Science and Technology, I worked for several years in both academia and industry. I have published over 80 technical papers in highly-ranked journals and refereed conference proceedings, including seven book chapters.

My research interests include antenna design, computational electromagnetics, machine learning applications, 3D-printed electronics, and 3D modeling.
