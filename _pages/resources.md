<strong>Warnings:</strong>
- Work in progress (WIP), use with caution. The unfilled information will be filled in as time permits.
- This list is to help the antenna community to find antenna-related journals easily. This list was created manually so it might be error-prone. Use it at your own risk.
- In case of doubt, go to the original website of the journal for the latest information. Google is your friend in that case.
- If you want to help, let me know. This table is written as an Markdown file and can be updated sooner if anybody wants to help.


If you have read above warnings, letâ€™s move on.\
