<strong>Warnings:</strong>
- Work in progress (WIP), use with caution. The unfilled information will be filled in as time permits.
- This list is to help the antenna community to find antenna-related journals easily. This list was created manually so it might be error-prone. Use it at your own risk.
- In case of doubt, go to the original website of the journal for the latest information. Google is your friend in that case.
- If you want to help, let me know. This table is written as an [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) file and can be updated sooner if anybody wants to help.


If you have read above warnings, letâ€™s move on.\
