Beamforming capabilities are required by the wireless communication networks of the future. Beamforming networks (BFNs), such as the Butler matrix or Rotman lens, are necessary for these circumstances to direct the beam in different directions. But creating such BFNs is not easy. These networks demand the user to be well-versed in computer-aided design technologies in addition to sophisticated mathematical formulas for creating such BFNs. We have been working on creating GUI-based software to handle the construction of such designs. Without having to worry about the underlying physics of the design, such software gives the user a number of options for fine-tuning the design of such networks. In this way, it is simple to import the BFN produced by the software into modern simulators and modify it as necessary. The presentation will summarize the key takeaways from our extensive experience developing software of this type for electromagnetic applications.\
