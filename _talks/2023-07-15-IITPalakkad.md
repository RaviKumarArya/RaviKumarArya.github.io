Periodic structures play a fundamental role in the field of electromagnetics, providing unique and versatile ways to manipulate electromagnetic waves. These structures are characterized by their repeating patterns, which give rise to various intriguing phenomena and properties. Periodic structures enable the control of wave propagation by guiding and redirecting electromagnetic energy and manipulating its polarization and phase. They find applications in diverse fields, including antenna design, and photonics. The study and utilization of periodic structures have opened up new frontiers in electromagnetics, paving the way for innovative devices and technologies with enhanced performance and functionality. In the past, we used periodic structures for design on reflectarray, transmitarray, superstrate, and lens designs. The presentation will summarize the key takeaways from our experience developing electromagnetic designs using periodic structures.\
