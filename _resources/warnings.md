### First thing first, read these warnings.

- Work in progress (WIP), use with caution. The unfilled information will be filled in as time permits.
- This list is to help the antenna community to find antenna-related journals easily. This list was created manually so it might be error-prone. Use it at your own risk.
- In case of doubt, go to the original website of the journal for the latest information. Google is your friend in that case.
- If you want to help, let me know. This table is written as a Markdown file and can be updated sooner if anybody wants to help.
- Due to changing nature of publications, please check if the concerned journal is [predatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing) in nature. Please use your own judgment if you decide to publish in such journals. 

If you have read the above warnings, letâ€™s move on.
