### Information on general terms such as SCIE/SCI, Impact Factor, Scopus, CiteScore, etc. 

The journals can be divided into different journal-level metrics:
- [Impact Factor (IF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor), by Clarivate, based on the citations recorded in the [Web of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Science) database. Here, journals with IF are <strong>[SCIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Citation_Index_Expanded)</strong>-indexed journals. SCIE used to be called SCI earlier.
- [CiteScore (CS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CiteScore), produced by Elsevier, based on the citations recorded in the Scopus database. Here, journals with CS belong to <strong>[Scopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus)</strong> database.
- [Journal Citation Reports (JCR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_Citation_Reports), by Clarivate, based on the citations recorded in the Web of Science database.
